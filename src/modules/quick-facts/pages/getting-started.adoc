= Train Your First Model

:imagesdir: ../images/
:experimental:

This section shows how to train and export an example deep learning model that can be used for defect segmentation. The data used for training is from an image dataset of Ethernet ports.

== Preparation

Click link:https://docs.mech-mind.net//download/Mech-DLK/DefectDetection(NetworkPort).rar[here] to download the image dataset and unzip the file.

== Training Process

. *Labeling*: In this example, you will need to label the OK images and NG images in each dataset. OK means that the connectors meet quality requirements and NG means that there are defects such as deformations and fractures on the Ethernet ports.

+
Click image:icon_eraser.png[width=25, fit=line] to use the eraser tool to remove the labeled region.

+
For OK images that do not contain any defect, please select the image and then right-click and select btn:[Set to OK]. Please make sure that there is at least one OK image in each dataset.
